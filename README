This package implements vigenere cipher using Go.
This is my first shot at using Go so I may make improvements as I 'go' :)

NOTE: 

1. This program strips off all the special character and numerals from the plaintext before encrypting and changes the whole file to uppercase

2. The key must contain uppercase characters only

Command line syntax:
./vigenere <alphabetical-key> <plaintextfile> <ciphertextfile>
./vigenere-decrypt <alphabetical-key> <ciphertextfile> <recovered_plaintextfile>
